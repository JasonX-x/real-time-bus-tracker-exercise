# Real Time Bus Tracking

## Description

This project tracks the movement of a marker representing a bus along a predefined route between MIT and Harvard. The marker moves sequentially through a list of coordinates representing bus stops, updating its position on a map every second.

## How to Run

To run this project on your machine:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to implement the following improvements:
- Integrate real-time bus location data from an API to track actual bus movements.
- Enhance the visualization with additional features such as animated route lines or bus stop icons.
- Implement user controls to customize the bus route or adjust the speed of the marker animation.
